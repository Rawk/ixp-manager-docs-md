## Video Tutorial

We created a **rough and ready** video tutorial demonstrating the installation process using the automated script for IXP Manager v5.5.0 (April 2020) on Ubuntu LTS 18.04. *This is Barry's first attempt at video tutorials so please forgive the lighting and sound quality.* You can find the [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xI1KlEW8s4) in our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeW2fmMTBtE4fnlmg-2-evA).
