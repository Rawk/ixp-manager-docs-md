## Video Tutorial

We created a video tutorial demonstrating the installation process using the automated script for IXP Manager v5.5.0 (April 2020) on Ubuntu LTS 20.04.

The procedure is similar for v6.0 - **just be sure to use the [ubuntu-lts-2004-ixp-manager-v6.sh](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager/blob/release-v6/tools/installers/ubuntu-lts-2004-ixp-manager-v6.sh) script**.

You can find the [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U123-E8D-AI) in our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeW2fmMTBtE4fnlmg-2-evA). As always, [the full catalog of video tutorials is here](https://www.ixpmanager.org/support/tutorials).
