# Join the Community

It really helps the core IXP Manager team at [INEX](https://www.inex.ie/) to know that the community is growing. Every new user builds our momentum to keep developing and supporting the platform.

We maintain a [a community map](https://www.ixpmanager.org/community/world-map) and [statistics](https://www.ixpmanager.org/community/statistics) that are updated nightly.

To join our community and get on the map, you can complete [this online form](https://www.ixpmanager.org/community/users/submit).

If you don't have an IX-F ID or a PeeringDB ID that's fine, just leave those blank. You can register with PeeringDB yourself and we'll help out with an IX-F ID when you register with us.

If you have any questions about this, please reach out to us by email to `operations <at> inex.ie`.
