# Manual Installation

???+ note "**This page was updated in April 2020 for Ubuntu LTS 20.04.**"

## Video Tutorial

We created a video tutorial demonstrating the manual installation process for IXP Manager v5.5.0 (April 2020) on Ubuntu LTS 20.04. You can find the [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRIl1ioG6Ck) in our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeW2fmMTBtE4fnlmg-2-evA).

## Requirements

IXP Manager tries to stay current in terms of technology. Typically, this means some element of framework refresh(es) every couple of years and other more incremental package upgrades with minor version upgrades. As well as the obvious reasons for this, there is also the requirement to prevent developer apathy - insisting on legacy frameworks and packages that have been EOL'd provides a major stumbling block for bringing on new developers and contributors.

The current requirements for the web application are:

* a Linux / BSD host.
* MySQL version 5.7 or later **but you should use MySQL >=8.0 from April 2020**.
* Apache / Nginx / etc.
* PHP >= 7.4. **Note that IXP Manager will not run on older versions of PHP.**
* Memcached - optional but recommended.

To complete the installation using the included config/scripts, you will also need to have installed git (`apt install git`) and a number of PHP extensions (see the example `apt install` below).

Regrettably the potential combinations of operating systems, versions of same and then versions of PHP are too numerous to provide individual support. As such, we recommend installing IXP Manager on Ubuntu LTS 20.04 and we officially support this platform.

In fact we provide a complete installation script for this - see [the automated installation page](automated-script.md) for details. If you have any issues with the manual installation, the automated script should be your first reference to compare what you are doing to what we recommend.

For completeness, the IXP Manager installation script for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS installs:

```sh
apt install -qy apache2 php7.4 php7.4-intl php-rrd php7.4-cgi php7.4-cli          \
    php7.4-snmp php7.4-curl  php-memcached libapache2-mod-php7.4 mysql-server     \
    mysql-client php7.4-mysql memcached snmp php7.4-mbstring php7.4-xml php7.4-gd \
    php7.4-bcmath bgpq3 php-memcache unzip php7.4-zip git php-yaml                \
    php-ds libconfig-general-perl libnetaddr-ip-perl mrtg  libconfig-general-perl \
    libnetaddr-ip-perl rrdtool librrds-perl curl composer
```

If you are using a different platform, you will need to replicate the above as appropriate for your chosen platform.

### Get the IXP Manager Source

The code for IXP Manager is maintained on GitHub and the canonical repository is [inex/IXP-Manager](https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager).

Log into the server where you wish to install IXP Manager. Move to the directory where you wish to store the source (the automated script, our documentation and our examples use `/srv/ixpmanager` which we refer to as `$IXPROOT`). Note that it **should not** be cloned into any web exposed directory (e.g. do not clone to `/var/www`).

```sh
IXPROOT=/srv/ixpmanager
cd /srv
git clone https://github.com/inex/IXP-Manager.git ixpmanager
cd $IXPROOT   # /srv/ixpmanager
git checkout release-v5
chown -R www-data: bootstrap/cache storage
```

## Initial Setup and Dependancies


### Dependencies

Install the required PHP libraries:

```sh
cd $IXPROOT
composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

## Database Setup


Use whatever means you like to create a database and user for IXP Manager. For example:

```mysql
CREATE DATABASE `ixpmanager` CHARACTER SET = 'utf8mb4' COLLATE = 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci';
CREATE USER `ixpmanager`@`localhost` IDENTIFIED BY '<pick a password!>';
GRANT ALL ON `ixpmanager`.* TO `ixpmanager`@`localhost`;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Then edit `$IXPROOT/.env` and set the database options:

```dotenv
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=ixpmanager
DB_USERNAME=ixpmanager
DB_PASSWORD=<the password you picked above!>
```

Now create the database schema:

```sh
php artisan doctrine:schema:create
php artisan migrate
```

Some older scripts still rely on MySQL view tables. Create these with:

```sh
# We use root here as the views.sql also contain triggers
mysql -u root ixpmanager < $IXPROOT/tools/sql/views.sql
```

### Configuration

Edit `$IXPROOT/.env` and review and set/change all parameters. Hopefully this is mostly documented or clear but please start a discussion on the mailing list if you have difficultly and we'll update this and the example file's documentation as appropriate.

### Initial Database Objects


Using the settings you edited in `.env` we'll create some database objects. [Yes, a setup wizard needs to be built!].

First let's create the password for the admin user. The following will create a secure random password and hash it with bcrypt:

```sh
USERNAME=admin
USEREMAIL=your@email.address
IXPM_ADMIN_PW="$( openssl rand -base64 12 )"
ADMIN_PW_SALT="$( openssl rand -base64 16 )"
HASH_PW=$( php -r "echo escapeshellarg( crypt( '${IXPM_ADMIN_PW}', sprintf( '\$2a\$%02d\$%s', 10, substr( '${ADMIN_PW_SALT}', 0, 22 ) ) ) );" )
echo Your password is: $IXPM_ADMIN_PW
```

The following is taken from the IXP Manager installation script:


```mysql
mysql -u ixpmanager "-p${MYSQL_ROOT_PW}" $DBNAME <<END_SQL
INSERT INTO ixp ( name, shortname, address1, country )
    VALUES ( '${IXPNAME}', '${IXPSNAME}', '${IXPCITY}', '${IXPCOUNTRY}' );
SET @ixpid = LAST_INSERT_ID();

INSERT INTO infrastructure ( ixp_id, name, shortname, isPrimary )
    VALUES ( @ixpid, 'Infrastructure #1', '#1', 1 );
SET @infraid = LAST_INSERT_ID();

INSERT INTO company_registration_detail ( registeredName ) VALUES ( '${IXPNAME}' );
SET @crdid = LAST_INSERT_ID();

INSERT INTO company_billing_detail ( billingContactName, invoiceMethod, billingFrequency )
    VALUES ( '${NAME}', 'EMAIL', 'NOBILLING' );
SET @cbdid = LAST_INSERT_ID();

INSERT INTO cust ( name, shortname, type, abbreviatedName, autsys, maxprefixes, peeringemail, nocphone, noc24hphone,
        nocemail, nochours, nocwww, peeringpolicy, corpwww, datejoin, status, activepeeringmatrix, isReseller,
        company_registered_detail_id, company_billing_details_id )
    VALUES ( '${IXPNAME}', '${IXPSNAME}', 3, '${IXPSNAME}', '${IXPASN}', 100, '${IXPPEEREMAIL}', '${IXPNOCPHONE}',
        '${IXPNOCPHONE}', '${IXPNOCEMAIL}', '24x7', '', 'mandatory', '${IXPWWW}', NOW(), 1, 1, 0, @crdid, @cbdid );
SET @custid = LAST_INSERT_ID();

INSERT INTO customer_to_ixp ( customer_id, ixp_id ) VALUES ( @custid, @ixpid );

INSERT INTO user ( custid, username, password, email, privs, disabled, created )
    VALUES ( @custid, '${USERNAME}', ${HASH_PW}, '${USEREMAIL}', 3, 0, NOW() );
SET @userid = LAST_INSERT_ID();

INSERT INTO customer_to_users ( customer_id, user_id, privs, created_at )
    VALUES ( @custid, @userid, 3, NOW() );

INSERT INTO contact ( custid, name, email, created )
    VALUES ( @custid, '${NAME}', '${USEREMAIL}', NOW() );
END_SQL
```

And finally seed the database:

```sh
cd $IXPROOT
php artisan db:seed --force --class=IRRDBs
php artisan db:seed --force --class=Vendors
php artisan db:seed --force --class=ContactGroups
```

## File Permissions

The web server needs write access to some directories:

```sh
cd $IXPROOT
chown -R www-data: storage/ bootstrap/cache/ database/Proxies/
chmod -R u+rwX     storage/ bootstrap/cache/ database/Proxies/
```

## Setting Up Apache


Here is a sample virtual hosts file for IXP Manager (replace `{$IXPROOT}` as appropriate!):

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot ${IXPROOT}/public
    <Directory ${IXPROOT}/public>
        Options FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        Require all granted
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -s [OR]
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -l [OR]
        RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
        RewriteRule ^.*$ - [NC,L]
        RewriteRule ^.*$ /index.php [NC,L]
    </Directory>
    ErrorLog \${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog \${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

You also need to enable rewrite:

```sh
a2enmod rewrite
service apache2 restart
```

# Congratulations!


Your new IXP Manager installation should be accessible via your server's IP address using the username (`$USERNAME`) and password (`$IXPM_ADMIN_PW`) you set above.

If you plan to use this in production, you should:

* secure your server with an iptables firewall
* install an SSL certificate and redirect HTTP access to HTTPS
* complete the installation of the many features of IXP Manager such as route server generation, member stats, peer to peer graphs, etc.
* PLEASE TELL US! We'd like to add you to the users list at http://www.ixpmanager.org/users.php - just drop us an email to `operations <at> inex <dot> ie`.
